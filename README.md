# Python CLI Tool: Add Numbers and Transcribe Audio

Welcome to the Python CLI Tool that does two things: adds numbers and transcribes audio. Because why not?

## Features

- **Add Numbers**: Because calculators are too mainstream.
- **Transcribe Audio**: Convert your audio files to text using OpenAI's Whisper model. Perfect for when you need to know what was said but can't be bothered to listen.

## Installation

First, clone the repo because that's what all the cool kids do:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Adding Numbers

Why do math in your head when you can use a CLI tool?

```sh
python your_script.py add 2 3
```

Output:
```
5
```

### Transcribing Audio

Got an audio file? Let's turn that noise into text.

```sh
python your_script.py aud2txt path/to/your/audiofile
```

Output:
```
[Transcribed text here]
```
